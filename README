This program has been adapted from the var_coeff program written by Dhairya Malhotra.


COMPILING
---------
Require: Elemental (development version), PvFMM
PvFMM and Elemental must be in a place where the FindPVFMM and FindElemental cmake modules can find them.
PvFMM can be downloaded from: https://github.com/dmalhotra/pvfmm
Elemental can be found at: libelemental.org

To compile:
> mkdir build; cd build, cmake ..; make faims_tests
May need to use a toolchain with cmake to detect correct config

Troubleshooting:
Modify CMakeLists.txt as necessary. May need to add more paths to where CMake looks for libs and headers


COMMANDLINE OPTIONS
-------------------
-min_depth  <Int>    Minimum tree depth
-max_depth  <Int>    Maximum tree depth
-fmm_q      <Int>    Chebyshev polynomial degree
-fmm_m      <Int>    Multipole order (+ve even integer)

Example: ./build/faims_tests -fmm_q 6 -fmm_m 10 min_depth 3 -max_depth 5
